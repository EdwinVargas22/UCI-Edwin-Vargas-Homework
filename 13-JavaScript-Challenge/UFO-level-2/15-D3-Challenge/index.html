          <h2 style="text-align: center">Correlations Discovered Between Healthcare, Smoking, Obesity, Poverty, Age, and Household Income</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left">There is a positive correlation between Lacks HealthCare vs In Poverty which is an expectation because
          if large amount of people live in poverty there will be a lack in healthcare in these communities. There is a slight positive correlation 
          between Smokes vs In Poverty but with more data it will give us a clearer picture. It seems there to be a linear correlation between Obese vs In Poverty
          because most of the circle points hover between 28% to 32% for the Obese axis.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left">A part that is common in Lacks Healthcare vs Age, Smokes vs Age, and Obese vs Household Income is the circle
          points hover mainly between 36 to 40 age group. This is telling me the data that was collected were mainly people who fall between the 36 to 40 age group. 
          To get a clearer picture if there is any correlations, there needs to be more data collected from different age groups.</p>

          <p style="text-align: left">A common theme noticeable in Lacks Healthcare vs Household Income, Smokes vs Household Income, and Obese vs Household Income
          is most of the household incomes that make less their circle point starts high but as the household incomes starts to increase the circle point
          starts to move down.</p>
