## Background
It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

I will need to design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I will perform:

1. Data Engineering

2. Data Analysis
### Data Modeling
First inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.
